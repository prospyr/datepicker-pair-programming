    We want to build a calendar based datepicker. We should be able to select a specific date by
    select a tile in a calendar grid.

    It is okay to use a date library to help you with this task, we have pre-installed DayJS but you can choose any
    other library you are familiar with.

    TailwindCSS is available for styling, but you are not required to use it.

    Suggestions for getting started:
    - populate a list of dates (a utility function is available to you in the util directory)
    - create a calendar grid w/ days aligned correctly from Sun-Sat

export default function DatePicker(props: DatePickerProps) {
  return <div>Datepicker goes here</div>;
}
